This project provides an object-oriented bridge to the
graphviz dot layout algorithm.

Graphs are defined using the classes Graph, Node and Edge.
Layouting is done using the DotLayout class which simply
transforms a given graph object into a temporary dot file
which is then processed by the system command "dot". The output
of the command is then parsed to produce layout information for
the graph.

It does not support the full graphviz dot language.

And it is still alpha.
